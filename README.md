# ubuntu-post-install-script
A post install script to setup ubuntu just as I like after installation.

They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery, so I must give praise to snwh on github (https://github.com/snwh/ubuntu-post-install) who in no small part made this script possible for me, by graciously licensing the code as GPL v3.0.

Well I do not claim to be perfect or a master scripter/coder/programmer, just someone wanting to learn. Any tips or suggestions that constructive, then please contact me, I am always willing to learn if you have something to teach.

If you find the script useful or even if you find it hopeless, thanks for stopping by and looking, regardless.
